# Google Photo Metadata To Plex Tags

## Prerequisites:
VS Code: Update the SharedData Class at the bottom of Program.cs.

Export Your Google Photos Data using Google Takeout. (Unless there is a different way to get the JSON file associated with a single photo.)

Run on Plex Media Server location.

Visit the Plex Media Server page and locate the X-Plex-Token as a query string URL. (I normally have to choose a photo -> Get Info -> View XML -> look at URL query string params)
