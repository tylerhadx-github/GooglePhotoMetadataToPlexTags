Google Photo Metadata To Plex Tags

Preqs:

VS Code: Update the SharedData Class at the bottom of Program.cs
Export Your Google Photos Data using Google Takout.(Unless there is a different way to get the json file associated with a single photo.)
Run on plex media server location.
visit the plex media server page and locate the X-Plex-Token as a query string url 
(I normally have to choose a photo->Get Info->View XML -> look at url query string params)
